    <h3> NOTABLE ACHIEVEMENTS </h3>
   
    <h3> Designed, built and piloted a custom pod racer. 32 BBY Boonta Eve 
         Classic Race Champion </h3>

    <p> In my spare time at Walda's Parts junk shop I designed and built a 
        Class III open cockpit Podracer capable of 588 mph top speed. Went on 
        to win the Boonta Eve Classic race in 32 BBY - first ever win by a 
        human. Generated documented company revenue of over 59 wupiupi during 
        the course of my enslavement. </p>

    <h3> Oversight of DS1 and DS2 Orbital Battle Stations construction 
         projects </h3>

    <p> During my tenure as a Supreme Imperial Fleet Commander I was in charge 
        of large capital construction projects for the Deep Space Fleet. 
        Performed acceptance testing of the DS1 SuperLaser in 0 BBY by 
        annihilating Alderaan - a terrestrial class planet in the Core Worlds 
        region. Successfully tripled the deep space fire power of the imperial 
        fleet in accordance with the Tarkin Doctrine before losing both 
        projects to run-away photon torpedoes. </p>
